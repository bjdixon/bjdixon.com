About
====

My name is Brian, I guess I already wrote that above. Anyway, some stuff about me

* I'm a client-side and server-side programmer
* I like to do this with JavaScript but can sometimes be convinced to use Python
* I like Minmi, Nujabes and the show they produced music for, Samauri Champloo - [Samurai Champloo - Shiki no uta](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sccg1CZzi4)
* I also like Chatmonchy (performed the intro to Princess Jellyfish) - [Kuragehime](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMyUvqTYzJ4)
